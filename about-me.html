<p>This is me. I currently work at WorkingNation.</p>

<img src="images/workingnation.png">

<p>WorkingNation is a non-profit that makes documentaries to expose hard truths about the looming unemployment crisis and bring the country together to create new jobs for a changing economy.</p>

<p>WorkingNation has partnered with Academy Award-winning directors and producers to create a wide range of compelling programming that explains the high stakes of Structural Unemployment and investigates potential solutions to the problem.</p>

<p>The content has been created in a variety of formats: 5-7 minute digital shorts, data visualization and animation, TV news documentary segments, hour-long documentary features, short films, and more, all in order to promote sharing and maximize reach.</p>

<p>By working with and showcasing corporations, thought leaders, NPOs, foundations and local governments that are working on scalable solutions, WorkingNation hopes to start a national conversation about the issue and keep America working.</p>

<p>Prior to WorkingNation, I worked at the following companies</p>

<ul{text-align:center;}>
	<li>Paramount (2015)</li>
	<li>Netflix (2014)</li>
	<li>The Weinstein Company (2011-2013)</li>
	<li>Warner Brothers (2010-2011)</li>
</ul>

<p>Before working for those companies, I graduated from Syracuse University with a BS in Television, Radio, & Film and Psychology.</p>
